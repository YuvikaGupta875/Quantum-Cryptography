# Quantum-Cryptography
This repository contains implementations and simulations of Quantum Cryptography protocols, focusing on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using the BB84 protocol. Quantum cryptography leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication, providing theoretically unbreakable encryption. The core idea is that any attempt to eavesdrop on the communication will disturb the quantum states, making it detectable.

Key Features:
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using the BB84 Protocol: A widely used protocol that guarantees secure key exchange between two parties.
Quantum Simulation using Qiskit: Simulates quantum bits (qubits) to demonstrate how quantum states are transmitted and measured.
Real-time Key Exchange: Implementation of secure key sharing that can be integrated into communication systems.
Error Detection: Eavesdropping detection based on the disturbance of quantum states.
